## ðŸš€ Amigos Deployment Guide

Let's guide you through setting up the project locally, to deploy and test Amigos! Note that our app is built to run on iOS devices. 

### ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**:
  - We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download this from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
  - This will also install `npm`.
- **Homebrew**: In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
- **Git**: In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```
- **Expo CLI**: In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- **EAS CLI**: For building and submitting your app.
  ```bash
  npm install -g eas-cli
  ```
- **Xcode (Optional, for iOS Simulator)**:
  - Download Xcode from the Mac App Store.
  - After installation, open Xcode at least once. It will perform initial setup and install necessary components.
